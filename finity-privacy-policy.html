        <h1 class="h3 mb-2">Finity Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Effective date: February 5, 2026</p>
      </header>

      <div class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h2 class="h5 section-title">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">Finity respects user privacy and is committed to protecting financial and personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what data the Finity Android application may collect or access, how that data is used, and the choices available to users. The policy uses clear, factual descriptions of data handling practices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h2 class="h5 section-title">2. Data Collection &amp; Permissions</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">The app requests permissions only when a feature requires them. Permissions are used solely for the stated purposes below.</p>

        <div class="mb-3">
          <h3 class="h6">Camera Permission</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Used only for scanning expense receipts. Images captured for receipt scanning are processed on-device for text recognition. Images are not uploaded to our servers unless the user explicitly enables Cloud Backup.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
          <h3 class="h6">Contacts Permission</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Used only to assist users when selecting names while recording debts or shared expenses. Contact data is accessed temporarily to populate selection lists and is not stored on our servers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
          <h3 class="h6">Photos / Media Access</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Users may choose images from their gallery for receipt scanning. The app only accesses the image selected by the user and processes it on-device unless the user opts in to Cloud Backup.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="h6">Biometric Authentication</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Finity uses the device’s biometric systems (for example, fingerprint or face unlock) to provide a secure login option. The app never stores biometric data. It relies on the Android biometric APIs which return only a success or failure result.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h2 class="h5 section-title">3. Financial Data Storage</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All financial records (expenses, income, budgets, transactions) are stored locally on the user’s device using secure local storage mechanisms.</li>
          <li>By default, data is never sent to our servers.</li>
          <li>Data leaves the device only if the user enables Cloud Backup; in that case, backup files are stored in the user’s chosen cloud account as described below.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h2 class="h5 section-title">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">Finity integrates with certain third-party services. These services operate independently and maintain their own privacy policies.</p>

        <div class="mb-2">
          <h3 class="h6">Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Used to display ads in the free version. Google may collect device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID) and usage data to provide personalized or non-personalized advertising. Please consult Google’s privacy documentation for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-2">
          <h3 class="h6">Google Drive (Cloud Backup)</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Used only if the user enables Cloud Backup. Backup files are stored in the user’s Google Drive account and are not stored on Finity servers. Users control and manage these backups through their Google Drive settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="h6">On-device Text Recognition Library</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">A text recognition library is used for receipt OCR. Image processing and text extraction are performed on-device when possible. No receipt images are sent to external servers for OCR unless the user has explicitly enabled a cloud-based OCR or backup option.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-2 small text-muted">Third-party services listed above have separate privacy policies. We recommend reviewing those policies for details about their data practices.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 section-title">6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">Most user data remains on the device and is removed when the app is uninstalled.

Users are responsible for managing and deleting backups from their cloud account.</p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h2 class="h5 section-title">9. Security</h2>

Security practices include local device storage protections, optional biometric authentication, and support for encrypted backups when the user enables Cloud Backup through a compatible cloud provider.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-4 p-3">
